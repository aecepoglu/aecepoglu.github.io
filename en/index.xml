      <description>Please see http://aecepoglu.com/en/about . The about page describes why this blog exists, what I write about, and what you can expect to show up here in the future.
 I primarily post here in Turkish. The tr button in the navigation menu should take you there or you can click here: http://aecepoglu.com/
 I’ll start putting up some english-only content and translate some of my posts from Turkish soon enough. You can subscribe to my rss-feed to be notified when that happens.</description>

      <description>Hello,
 Welcome to my blog which started off because I had a lot to say in discussions I was having with my colleagues at work and realized long-form text would do my delivery the best justice.
   I write about programming in practice and theory Specifically about new and interesting tech that catches my eyes and that can further server what I’m now realising is my passion for simplicity.</description>
