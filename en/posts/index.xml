      <description>I am going to be sharing my solutions for Advent of Code 2021 on my blog; at this page
 I’m going to be using Dyalog-APL this year to solve the problems.
 As I go through each problem I’ll update that article with my solutions.
 At the end of the event I will write a blog-post about my impressions of APL.

      <description>Please see http://aecepoglu.com/en/about . The about page describes why this blog exists, what I write about, and what you can expect to show up here in the future.
 I primarily post here in Turkish. The tr button in the navigation menu should take you there or you can click here: http://aecepoglu.com/
 I’ll start putting up some english-only content and translate some of my posts from Turkish soon enough. You can subscribe to my rss-feed to be notified when that happens.</description>
